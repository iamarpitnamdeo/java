Notes of java

Single dimensional Array
int a[]=new int[5];
int a[]={33,2,3,4,5};

Multi dimensional Array
int [][]a1= new int[3][3];
int arr[][]={{1,2,3},{2,4,5},{4,4,5}};

Jagged Array

int arr[][] = new int[3][];  
arr[0] = new int[3];  
arr[1] = new int[4];  
arr[2] = new int[2];

arraycopy()-- used to copy one array to another

===========================>
String - generally string is a sequence of characters. 
But in java, string is an object that represents a sequence of characters.

java.lang.String class is used to create string objects

there are two ways to create string object
- by string literal (jvm go to string pool and provide reference to the string if already available)
     string literal are used in java to make java more memory efficient (no new object is created if it exist already in the string constant pool)
- by new keyword	

	in such case jvm will create  new object in normal non-pool heap memory.
