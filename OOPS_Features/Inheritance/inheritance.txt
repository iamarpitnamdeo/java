Inheritance in java -
What
-Inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviour of a parent object.
-The idea behing inheritance in java is that you can create new classes that are build upon existing classes.
-When you inherit from existing class you can use methods and fields of the parent class.

- Inheritance represents IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-chil relationship

Why

- For Method Overriding(so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
- For code reusability

Terms used in Inheritance
Class - group of objects which have common properites. Template of blueprint of objects

Sub Class/Child Class - subclass is the class which inherits the other class.
It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.

Super class/Parent class - Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features.
It is also called a base class or a parent class.

Types - there can be three types of inheritances in java: Single, Multilevel, and hierarhcical

Multiple and Hybrid inheritance is supported thorugh interface only.

Q1 - Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
To reduce complexity and simplify the language multiple inheritance is not supported in java

Ambiguity will be occuring.
