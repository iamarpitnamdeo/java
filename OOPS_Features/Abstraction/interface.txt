Java Interface
- interface is a blueprint of class.
- it has static constants and abstract methods.
- is-a relationship
- java8 we can have default and static methods in an interface
- java 9 we can have private methods in an interface 

- use to support multiple inheritance
- to achieve loose coupling

- variables are public static and final by default.
- methods are public and abstract 
- empty interface is called marker or tag interface


-The Java compiler adds public and abstract keywords before the interface method.
 Moreover, it adds public, static and final keywords before data members.
 
 ========================================
 
 If a class implements multiple interfaces, or an interface extends multiple interfaces,
 it is known as multiple inheritance.
