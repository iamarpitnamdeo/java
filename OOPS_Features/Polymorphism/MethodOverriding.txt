 Method Overriding 

- if a child class provides specific implementation of a method declared in parent class it is termed as overriding.(runtime polymorphism)

- the method must have the same name and parameters 
- should be an is-a relaiton ship (inheritance)
- Example : reserve bank getting rate of interest from different banks 

- Staic methods cannot be overriden
- main method cannot be overriden

- if you are overriding any method, the overriden method (i.e. declared in subclass) must not be more restrictive.
