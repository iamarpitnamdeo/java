Java Abstraction 

- Process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

- show only essential things to the user and hide the internal details. (Sending SMS)

- focus on what object does instead of how it does it.

- Two ways 
    1. Abstract class
    2. Interface 

- ABSTRACT CLASS

- class declared as abstract , cannot be instantiated.
- can have abstract and non abstract methods 
- can have constructors and static methods 
- final methods (which will force the sub class not to change body of the method)

- ABSTRACT METHODS

- method which declared as abstract , does not have implementation 

if there is an abstract method in a class , that class must be abstract

if extend abstract class, either provide the implementation of mthod or maket his class abstract 

- if we do not wan to implement all methods of interface , first implement interface in a abstract class, then extend this abstract calss to a normal class.
